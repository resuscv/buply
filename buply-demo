### You can do various pre-backup checks here...
### For example...mount the drive where you want to write your backup

# The directory to back up
SRC_DIR=$HOME/Documents
# The name of the backup in the repo
BACKUP_NAME=Documents


# Storage directory for the backup, becomes:
#   ${BUP_DIR_BASE} / ${BUP_DIR_GENERAL} - <datestring>
BUP_DIR_BASE=/media/nas/backups-bup
BUP_DIR_GENERAL=backup


# How often do we want a new full backup?
period="month"
# period="annual"

# How often to do a fsck?
fsck_period="1 day"
fsck_period="never"

# Should parity information be generated? (using par2)
# By default parity information is generated.
# generate_parity_data=false

### You can fancy things with fsck_period too...
### For example:
###   on-home-network \
###     && fsck_period="1 day" \
###     || fsck_period="never"
### where 'on-home-network' returns true/false if your IP is your home IP, so only
### do fsck if you are at home, otherwise, save bandwidth and don't do the fsck.
